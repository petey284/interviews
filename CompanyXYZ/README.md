### Mars Rover Code Challenge

Coding challenge designed to work with input data as text file.

My solution reads a file and first establishes the grid based on the first line of input. Next, I capture the next line to identify where the rover is located. I capture the next line to process the instructions.

I loop until the end of the file. After capturing the rover(s) and running the instructions, I print out the position of the rovers.

With more time, I would have written some tests throughout the process.

Assumptions:
The grid is set once and only once.
The only way of providing input is through a file.

Overall time to solution was about 2 and a half hours.


### Instructions

Build the solution and then run the input using the following command:

```
CompanyXYZCodingTest.exe  < input_data.txt
```
